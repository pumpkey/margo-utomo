            <p id="short-description"><b>Banyuwangi</b> is the most eastern regency of East Java. Jember is the closest neighbour on the west side whilst Bali is only apart by the Bali Strait. The native people of Banyuwangi are the Osing. They have their own community and speak in their own dialect, a combination language between Javanese and Balinese.</p>

            <p>The diverse natural scenery, art, culture, customs and traditions have created Banyuwangi as a unique destination worth to be visited. The beauty of nature is spread across the Banyuwangi district from west to the east. The mountains, forests and beaches create such outstanding attractions like the Ijen Crater, the Meru Betiri National Park and Sukamade.</p>
            
            <div id="full-description" style="display: none;">
                <p>Typical Handicrafts and traditional food are found plentiful in East Java. Batik Tulis which has its own characteristic in comparison with batiks from Central Java is a trademark famous for East Java. Gandrung dance is the well-known welcome dance performed only in Banyuwangi.</p>
                
                <p><b>Kalibaru</b> is a typical mid-size hill-country city. It is formed of 5 smaller villages. It is located on one of the busiest transit roads in Indonesia connecting Banyuwangi to Jember, Surabaya, Malang and Yogyakarta. Even though the road has been improved greatly, some stretches are still very narrow slowing down the traffic as overtaking the many heavy trucks is often not possible due to the oncoming traffic.</p>
                
                <p>A sizeable part of Kalibaru city is located along this main trunk road covering 7 km from the entrance to the exit. Kalibaru has a railway station connecting Kalibaru to Banyuwangi and to Surabaya. About 60,000 persons live in Kalibaru. Kalibaru is in the plantation belt with many big-size plantations. Being on 420 meters above sea level, the climate in Kalibaru is cooler than in the low lying areas like Banyuwangi, Jember, Surabaya and Malang. In the evening and during the night it can become quite cool at times.</p>
                
                <p>Bali and its Ngurah Rai International Airport are about 220 km away from Kalibaru which can be reached in about 6-7 hours, crossing the Bali Straits in ferries plying this route 24 hours.</p>
                
                <p>From the west side, the closest large international airport is Juanda Airport in Surabaya. It can be reached by either car, train or by plane from Blimbingsari Airport in Banyuwangi. The overland journey takes about 5 hours and passes through constantly changing scenes of life in a tropical paradise, busy towns, sleepy rural villages, terraced rice fields, plantations, orchards, forests and happy people with their warm smiles.</p>
                
                <p>The road journey winds over the forested Merawan range whilst the train passes under it through a historic tunnel which was built between 1902 and 1920 during the Dutch administration.</p>

                                    Witness one of the greatest natural events of surviving pre-historic turtles as a great and unforgettable vacation experience. The principal object of this adventure tour is watching the turtles laying their eggs on a virgin secluded beach which is well-known as Sukamade Beach. Before searching for the turtles you will pass through tropical low-land rain forest on the southern coast of Java. The peak season for green turtles (mostly found laying their eggs on Sukamade Beach) is on during the wet season but usually reduced activity can be observed during the entire year.

                                    The tour to the Alas Purwo National Park is an outstanding experience to observe the pristine 
                                    tropical low-land rainforest and the mangrove forests on the other side of the National Park. 
                                    Alas Purwo which means “the first forest” is one of the best preserved rain forests which is 
                                    protected by myths and law. The local people believe that it is a sacred forest. There are several other 
                                    attractions to visit such as Ngagelan Beach (the turtle sanctuary), Pura Giri Salaka (an old 
                                    Hindu temple), Sadengan (the observation tower), and Trianggulasi Beach.

                                    There will be unforgettable moments to discover Banteng/Javanese bulls (Bos javanicus), 
                                    Green Pea Fowls (Pavo muticus), and Indian Deer (Muntiacus muntjak) in the wild. 
                                    During the dry season, most animals will go to the waterhole in savannah Sadengan. 
                                    An additional trip to one of the biggest mangrove forests can be arranged on Bedul Estuary 
                                    or Segara Anakan. It takes one hour by typical traditional fisher boat (katir) which is 
                                    really a wonderful experience.

                                    An enjoyable, interesting and educational excursion to one of the plantations which was 
                                    established in the early 1900s during the colonial era. It provides knowledge about plantation 
                                    crops such as rubber, coffee, cocoa, and clove as well as the processing. An excellent trip to 
                                    find out the long process of those commodities before ending up as a tire on your car or a nice 
                                    hot cup of coffee or hot chocolate on your dining table. The processing of rubber is possible 
                                    to watch throughout the year but sometimes will stop on rainy days (especially early morning rain). 
                                    The coffee season is from June to September, and the cocoa season is in May and October. On this 
                                    tour, you will also observe home industries like tin smith on the way or stop at villages with 
                                    different farming crops (chili pepper, melon, peanut, etc.) depending on the season.
